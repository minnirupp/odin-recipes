# odin-recipes

This is the first project in The Odin Project where I will create my first website. In order to setup this project, I have learned about the command line and Git and used those skills to create this project in the terminal. These skills include:

- Terminal Commands to:
  - Navigate Directories
  - Create Directories
  - Create Files
- Creating a Git account
- Creating new repos on the Git account
- Using terminal commands to clone the repo locally
- Adding commits from the command line
- Adding notes from the command line
- Stashing changes
- Pushing changes to the repo on Git

At the completion of this project, I will have learned how to create a basic website with HTML elements and basic navigation.
