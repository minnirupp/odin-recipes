# odin-recipes

This is the first project in 'The Odin Project' Foundations Course. In order to setup this project, I had to learn about the command line and Git. I've used those skills to create this project through the terminal. Those skills include:

- Terminal Commands to:
  - Navigate Directories
  - Create Directories
  - Create Files
- Creating a Git account
- Creating new repos on the Git account
- Using terminal commands to clone the repo locally
- Adding commits from the command line
- Adding notes from the command line
- Stashing changes
- Pushing changes to the repo on Git

At the completion of this project, I will have learned how to create a basic website with HTML elements and basic navigation.
