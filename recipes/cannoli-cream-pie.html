    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I make this cannoli cream pie because the best part of cannoli is the filling. I add mini chocolate chips and lightly salted pistachios because they're my favorite cannoli fillings. It comes together in just a few minutes, and sets up in the fridge, so you can get back to enjoying the holidays.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (9-inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup confectioner's sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups full fat ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped lightly salted pistachios</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mini chocolate chips, plus more for topping</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F(165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake graham cracker crust in the preheated oven until golden brown and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Add heavy whipping cream to a clean bowl, and beat with an electric mixer to stiff peaks. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese and powdered sugar together in another bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Fold in ricotta, vanilla extract, and salt until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Gently fold whipped cream into ricotta mixture. Gently fold in chopped pistachios and mini chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Pour the filing into the prepared pie crust and spread evenly. Chill in the refrigerator for 5 hours or up to overnight. Top with mini chocolate chips to serve.</li>
    </ol>
